                <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing
                    and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                    the industry's standard dummy text ever since
                    the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                    of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                    book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                    but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
                    in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                    with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
